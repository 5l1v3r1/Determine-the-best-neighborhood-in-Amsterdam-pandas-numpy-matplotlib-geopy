# Coursera_Capstone_Week4-5
This project is a "Capstone Project" of Coursera - "IBM Applied Data Science Capstone Course" in the fourth/fifth weeks. In this project, we want to determine the best neighborhood in Amsterdam for the entrepreneurs to open a new restaurant. In the project, we tried to use most of the python scripts, libraries, virtualization of data, foursquare api.. etc.

Please, pay attention!... It is only a capstone final project and it is not claimed that the result of the project is 100% proper for trade and investing industry. On the other hand, it can be helpful in the decision process for the entrepreneurs and/or give an idea to make a comprehensive project to researchers.
